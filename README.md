The scope of the project is to develop a system that recognizes fake news. As part of this project, it is necessary to train a news classification model as true or false. After training, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our model in relation to a set of metrics such as classification accuracy, training and classification time. Next, we will implement an application that accepts a news text as input and returns the category it belongs to (fake or true).
